# Merging two sorted sequences

Merging two sorted sequences is taking each sequence and adding them to a third sorted sequence. The program reads two input files. The contents of these files are added to an initial array. The array is sorted ascendingly in order to start moving the integers in the initial array to the new and final array. During this process, the program compares an integer from the initial array with the integers in the final array, if the program found a similar integer in the final array it moves to the next number, if no similar integer was found then the program adds this integer to the final array and then it moves on. Finally, after successfully moving all the integers to the final array, the program shows the output on the compiler then writes the final array to an output folder.
