# Binary Seach Tree: Ordered List

Binary trees are useful when we want to access and manipulate data quickly without changing their order. When this program runs, the user is given 
a menu prints the following options in the terminal:
- Add an item
- Remove an item
- Search for an item
- Re-initialize the list to be empty
- Print the contents of the list
- Print the number of items in the list
The items are integers that are stored in the binary tree.
