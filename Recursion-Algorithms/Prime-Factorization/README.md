# Prime Factorization

Prime factorization is a process where a number is divided by its prime numbers, starting with the smallest prime number to the largest prime number, until that number can only be divided by itself. The program uses a function that divides a number by its smallest prime number and uses a recursive function to reach that largest prime number before it is divided by itself.
