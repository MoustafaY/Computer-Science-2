# IMPLEMENTING AND MANIPULATING EXPRESSION 

Binary Expression trees can be very useful in quickly accessing, manipulating and printing data. The program reads data from an input file, then builds a binary expression tree based on the contents of that file. By traversing through the binary expression tree in different orders, we are able to print an expression in three different forms, the infix form, the post order form, and the pre order form. The program calculates the value of each expression and prints that expression along with its value.
