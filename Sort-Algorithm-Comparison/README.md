# Comparing Sorting Algorithms

Sorting algorithms are useful in organizing data, in this project the program uses and compares four sorting algorithms:
- Insertion sort
- Merge sort
- Quick sort
- Heap sort 
The program compares these sorting algorithms by counting the number of notations of each sorting algorithm. First the program asks for the number of values to be randomly generated, then asks for the seed value to randomly generate values, then the program asks the user whether to print the sorted arrays or not. Finally the program prints the number of notations each sorting algorithm took to sort the randomly generated values, and prints the sorted arrays if the user wanted to.
