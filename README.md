# Major-Projects

The following projects were from the computer science 2 class, where I learned about data structures and algorithms.
These are projects where I applied concepts such as queues, linked lists, sorting alogrithms and more. 
For each project there is a readme file that gives a brief description about what concept is the project about, and there is additional documentation within each project such as a design document and user manual.
These projects are written in c++ and can run using g++ compiler or vs studio compiler.
